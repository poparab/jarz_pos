## Comprehensive Invoice Cases Coverage (NEW)

The latest test additions provide complete coverage for all six invoice scenarios required by the business:

### Six Invoice Cases

1. **Paid + Settle Now** (test_invoice_cases_integration.py)
   - Customer pays online/POS upfront
   - Courier settles immediately with cash
   - Creates: DN, JE (DR Freight / CR Cash), CT (Settled)

2. **Paid + Settle Later** (test_invoice_cases_integration.py)
   - Customer pays online/POS upfront
   - Courier settles at end of day/week
   - Creates: DN, JE (DR Freight / CR Creditors), CT (Unsettled)
   - Settlement: settle_single_invoice_paid()

3. **Unpaid + Settle Now** (test_invoice_cases_integration.py)
   - Customer pays on delivery (COD)
   - Courier settles immediately with cash
   - Creates: PE (customer payment), DN, JE (DR Freight / CR Cash), CT (Settled)

4. **Unpaid + Settle Later** (test_invoice_cases_integration.py)
   - Customer pays on delivery (COD)
   - Courier settles at end of day/week
   - Creates: DN, CT (Unsettled tracking order + shipping)
   - Settlement: settle_courier_collected_payment()

5. **Sales Partner** (test_sales_partner_flow.py, test_invoice_cases_integration.py)
   - **Cash variant:** Branch takes cash from rider on dispatch
     - Creates cash PE, Sales Partner Transaction (mode=Cash)
   - **Online variant:** Customer pays online to partner account
     - Routes to partner receivable subaccount
     - Sales Partner Transaction (mode=Online)
   - Fee calculation: (commission + online_fee) × (1 + 14% VAT)

6. **Pickup** (test_pickup_flow.py, test_invoice_cases_integration.py)
   - Customer picks up at branch (no delivery)
   - Shipping income and expense = 0
   - Works with all paid/unpaid + settle now/later combinations
   - Detection: custom_is_pickup, is_pickup, pickup, or [PICKUP] in remarks

### Settlement Strategy Coverage

All four settlement strategies are thoroughly tested:

| Invoice Status | Settlement Timing | Handler | Test Coverage |
|----------------|------------------|---------|---------------|
| Unpaid | Now | handle_unpaid_settle_now | 14 tests in test_settlement_strategies.py |
| Unpaid | Later | handle_unpaid_settle_later | Integrated in multiple test files |
| Paid | Now | handle_paid_settle_now | 14 tests in test_settlement_strategies.py |
| Paid | Later | handle_paid_settle_later | Integrated in multiple test files |

### POS and Kanban Integration

- **POS Profile:** Required for settlement, resolves cash accounts
- **Kanban States:** All transitions tested
  - Received → Processing → Preparing → Out for Delivery → Completed
- **State Change Logic:** DN creation on "Out for Delivery" (25 tests)
- **Branch Propagation:** custom_kanban_profile flows through all documents

### Accounting Coverage

Tests validate all accounting entries:
- **Payment Entry (PE):** Customer payments, sales partner cash collection
- **Journal Entry (JE):** Freight expense, courier settlements, accruals
- **Courier Transaction (CT):** Unsettled/Settled tracking
- **Sales Partner Transaction:** Fee tracking with payment mode

### Idempotency Patterns

All critical operations tested for idempotency:
- Delivery Note creation (reuses via remarks check)
- Sales Partner Transaction (token: SPTRN::{invoice_name})
- Journal Entry settlement (title-based lookup)
- Payment Entry allocation (outstanding amount check)

## Testing Best Practices Implemented

   - Account for permission errors
   - Catch and handle exceptions appropriately

4. **Permission Handling**
   - Tests account for role-based access
   - Handle PermissionError exceptions
   - Test manager-only endpoints appropriately

5. **Edge Cases**
   - Boundary conditions tested
   - Special cases covered
   - Mathematical correctness validated

6. **Documentation**
   - Clear docstrings for all test classes
   - Descriptive test method names
   - Inline comments for complex logic
