# Patches added in this section will be executed after doctypes are migrated
# NOTE: The following legacy field-creation patches are intentionally disabled for CLEAN installs
# to avoid conflicts with current fixtures and before_migrate cleanup. If you are upgrading an
# older site that requires these specific transformations, re-enable as needed.
