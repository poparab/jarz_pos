"""Jarz POS â€“ Invoice-related API endpoints.

This module serves as the authoritative location for all invoice-level
operations (create invoice, register payment, etc.) that need to be
consumed by external clients such as the React-Native mobile app.

Internally we continue to rely on the proven logic implemented in
``jarz_pos.jarz_pos.page.custom_pos.custom_pos``.  By importing and
re-exporting those callables here we achieve a clear, dedicated import
path (``jarz_pos.jarz_pos.api.invoices``) while maintaining full
backwards-compatibility with legacy endpoints.
