"""Enhanced tests for POS invoice creation covering all 6 business cases.

This module tests POS invoice creation with comprehensive coverage of:
  Case 1: Unpaid + Settle Now (courier collects, immediate settlement)
  Case 2: Unpaid + Settle Later (courier collects, deferred settlement)
  Case 3: Paid + Settle Now (branch collected, immediate courier fee)
  Case 4: Paid + Settle Later (branch collected, deferred courier fee)
  Case 5: Sales Partner invoices (online payment flow)
  Case 6: Pickup orders (no delivery, no courier)
