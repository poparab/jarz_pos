"""Tests for settlement strategies service.

This module tests the business logic for the 6 invoice settlement cases:
  1. unpaid + settle now (courier collects, immediate settlement)
  2. unpaid + settle later (courier collects, deferred settlement)
  3. paid + settle now (branch collected, immediate courier fee settlement)
  4. paid + settle later (branch collected, deferred courier fee settlement)
  5. Sales Partner invoices (online payment flow)
  6. Pickup orders (no delivery, no courier settlement)
