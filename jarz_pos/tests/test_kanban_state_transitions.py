"""Enhanced tests for kanban API and state transitions.

This module tests the kanban board functionality including:
  - State transitions (Received → Processing → Preparing → Out For Delivery → Completed)
  - Delivery Note creation on Out For Delivery transition
  - Payment Entry creation for Sales Partner invoices
  - Business logic for paid vs unpaid invoices
  - Integration with settlement strategies
